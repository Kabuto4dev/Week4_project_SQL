# Week4_project_SQL_analysis_data_anime
ANIME_pipeline. PROPUESTA para el camino a un nuevo estreno

# Description
MyAnimeList is a popular platform where users can create lists of the anime they have watched, rate and review anime, and discover new anime. This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of the MyAnimeList dataset to uncover trends and patterns in the data.

The dataset includes various attributes about each anime, such as its title, genres, type, number of episodes, average rating, and the number of members who have added it to their lists. By leveraging SQL queries in MySQL Workbench, we aim to extract meaningful insights and present the results in a clear and understandable manner.

Through this analysis, we can answer questions such as:
- Which anime have the highest ratings?
- What are the most common genres of anime?
- How does the average number of episodes vary by anime type?

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following main features:

- **Anime_ID**: Unique identifier for each anime.
- **Title**: Title of the anime.
- **Genres**: Genres associated with the anime.
- **Type**: Type of anime (TV, Movie, OVA, etc.).
- **Episodes**: Number of episodes.
- **Rating**: Average rating.
- **Members**: Number of members who have added the anime to their lists.
